  <p><strong>Fever</strong> (also known as <strong>pyrexia</strong> or <strong>controlled hyperthermia</strong>  is a common medical sign characterized by an elevation of temperature above the normal range of 36.5–37.5 °C (98–100 °F) due to an increase in the body temperature regulatory set-point This increase in set-point triggers increased muscle tone and shivering.</p>
  <p>As a person's temperature increases there is generally a feeling of cold despite an increasing body temperature. Once the new temperature is  reached there is a feeling of warmth. A fever is one of the body's immune responses which attempts to neutralize a bacterial or viral infection.  A fever can be caused by many different conditions ranging from benign  to potentially serious. With the exception of very high temperatures,  treatment to reduce fever is often not necessary; however, antipyretic medications can be effective at lowering the temperature, and this may improve the affected person's comfort.</p>
